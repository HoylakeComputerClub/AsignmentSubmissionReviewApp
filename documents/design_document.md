# Assignment Submission and Review App Design Document

## Requirements
A learner should be able to login to the application and see a dashboard that outlines the following information:
- What assignments ad due, and when.
- A page to review past assignments (optional).
- Status of an assignment that is currently under review and if it needs updating.
- A way to submit (or re-submit) an assignment for review.

When submitting an assignment, the learner will be asked to provide the following information:
- **Github URL** the the public repository.
- which **branch** is the current one.

Once submitted, the **status** updates from `pending submission` to `submitted`
